# CineMatch

CineMatch is an AI-powered movie recommendation web application that uses advanced NLP algorithms (BM25, TF-IDF, Bag of Words, and BERT) to suggest movies based on your input. The project is split into a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend.

---

## Features
- Modern React frontend with Tailwind CSS
- Express.js backend with modular controllers, routes, and middlewares
- Multiple NLP-based recommendation algorithms (BM25, TF-IDF, Bag of Words, BERT)
- OMDb API integration for movie posters and IMDb links
- Ready for deployment on Vercel

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/lakshmannarendra/CineMatch.git

```

### 2. Backend Setup
```sh
cd backend
npm install
```

- Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder:
  ```env
  OMDB_API_KEY=your_omdb_api_key
  ```
- (Optional) Edit `vercel.json` if you change the entry point or folder structure.

#### Run Backend Locally
```sh
node server.js
# or
npm start
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```sh
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

- Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` folder:
  ```env
  VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
  ```
  - For production, set this to your deployed backend URL (e.g. `https://cine-match-nlp.vercel.app/api`)

#### Run Frontend Locally
```sh
npm run dev
```
